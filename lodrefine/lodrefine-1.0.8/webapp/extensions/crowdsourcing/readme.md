# Crowdsourcing for OpenRefine/LODRefine

An extension for OpenRefine to:
* create new jobs on CrowdFlower service from OpenRefine project
* upload data to CrowdFlower service from OpenRefine project
* get results from CrowdFlower service into OpenRefine project

Extension requires CrowdFlowerClient library. You can get it [here] (https://github.com/sparkica/CrowdFlowerClient).

### Crowdsourcing in OpenRefine or LODRefine?
It works best (and looks best) in LODRefine - it is already integrated into it, no need to build and install it. 
Of course you can can use it in OpenRefine, but you may experience a glitch or two.

**Note**: this extension doesn't work well in the _old_ Refine v2.5, because 2.5 it uses some outdated libraries.
